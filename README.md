## Ai-Traffic-Violation-Detection- 

## Introduction-
Traffic related rule violations-such as helmet absence,seatbelt non usege mobile phone usage while driving overspeeding and red-light jumping are major causes of accidens. manual monitoring is inefficient and expensive. This project demonstrates how AI Methods (Computer Vision +MachineLearning) can automate traffic rule enforcement using AI Cameras. This is an example project for the Elements of AI (UniversityofHelsinki) course.

## Summary-
This project uses computer vision and Ai methods to automatically detected traffic rules violations from Camera footage the system identifies vehicles, tracks their movements and flags violations such as overspeeding, signal jumping,and lane discipline issues. the goal is to demonstrate how AI can improve road safety, support authorities, and reduce human error in traffic monitoring.the project includes data preprocessing a simple detection model and a clear explanation of how AI methods are applied.

# Conclusion-
This project demonstrates how AI Methods-computer vision,Machine Learning,Deep Learning, and OCR-can work together to solve a real-world problem:Traffic rule monitoring and enforcement. It shows the real impact of AI in daily life and fits perfectly as an example project for the Elements of AI course.
